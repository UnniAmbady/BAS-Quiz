Question:      What is the primary function of carbon-dioxide sensors in a Building Automation System?  

Modal Answer:  They serve as a reliable proxy for human occupancy intensity, enabling demand-controlled ventilation to improve indoor air quality and reduce energy consumption.
Student Ans:  Used to read carbon-dioxide real time value and send to BMS to perform the associated operation

GPT Feedback:
Right points: None of the answer directly addresses the main points of the correct answer.
Improve on: The student answer lacks detail about occupancy intensity and indoor air quality. It should mention how carbon-dioxide levels relate to these concepts. A better response could be: "They measure carbon-dioxide levels to indicate human occupancy, allowing for demand-controlled ventilation that improves indoor air quality and reduces energy use."
