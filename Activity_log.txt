Question:      What is the purpose of carbon-dioxide sensors in a BAS?  

Modal Answer:  They serve as a proxy for human occupancy intensity, enabling demand-controlled ventilation to improve indoor air quality and reduce energy consumption.
Student Ans:  To measure the level of CO2 in the room and ensure that it is not exceeding the maximum limit of 1000 ppm.

GPT Feedback:
Right points: The answer focuses on measuring CO2 levels.
Improve on: It doesn't mention the proxy for human occupancy or the benefits of demand-controlled ventilation. It should include how monitoring CO2 helps improve indoor air quality and reduce energy consumption.

Question:     What is the main function of temperature sensors in a Building Automation System (BAS)?
Modal Answer: Temperature sensors provide real-time data on the temperature of spaces or equipment, allowing the BAS to modulate set-points and optimize heating and cooling systems.
Student Ans:  To measure the Temperature of many parameters

GPT Feedback:
Right points: None.
Improve on: The answer is too vague and does not address the function of temperature sensors in a BAS. It should explain that temperature sensors provide real-time data for optimizing heating and cooling systems.
