Question:      What is the primary function of temperature sensors in a Building Automation System (BAS)?  

Modal Answer:  Temperature sensors provide real-time data to zone controllers to precisely modulate heating, cooling, and ventilation based on the temperature of a space or equipment.
Student Ans:  The primary function of temperature sensors in a Building Automation System (BAS) is used to:

1. Control HVAC systems (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) – ensuring that indoor environments remain within desired temperature ranges for comfort and energy efficiency.

2. Enable energy management – by detecting temperature variations and optimizing system operations to reduce energy consumption.

3. Support automation logic – where temperature readings can trigger actions such as turning on/off heating or cooling units, adjusting ventilation, or sending alerts.
