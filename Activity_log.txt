Question:      What is the purpose of carbon-dioxide sensors in a BAS?  

Modal Answer:  They serve as a proxy for human occupancy intensity, enabling demand-controlled ventilation to improve indoor air quality and reduce energy consumption.
Student Ans:  To measure the level of CO2 in the room and ensure that it is not exceeding the maximum limit of 1000 ppm.

GPT Feedback:
Right points: The answer focuses on measuring CO2 levels.
Improve on: It doesn't mention the proxy for human occupancy or the benefits of demand-controlled ventilation. It should include how monitoring CO2 helps improve indoor air quality and reduce energy consumption.
Score: 70%
