Question:     What role do temperature sensors play in a Building Automation System (BAS)?
Modal Answer: Temperature sensors serve as the backbone of a BAS, providing real-time data that enables precise control of heating, cooling, and comfort algorithms.
Student Ans:  Sense the temperature and send signal to BMS

GPT Feedback:
Right points: Sense the temperature.
Improve on: Should mention "real-time data" and "precise control." Complete answer needed.
Score: 70%

Question:      What is the primary function of carbon-dioxide sensors in a Building Automation System?  

Modal Answer:  They serve as a reliable proxy for human occupancy intensity, enabling demand-controlled ventilation to improve indoor air quality and reduce energy consumption.
Student Ans:  Used to read carbon-dioxide real time value and send to BMS to perform the associated operation

GPT Feedback:
Right points: None of the answer directly addresses the main points of the correct answer.
Improve on: The student answer lacks detail about occupancy intensity and indoor air quality. It should mention how carbon-dioxide levels relate to these concepts. A better response could be: "They measure carbon-dioxide levels to indicate human occupancy, allowing for demand-controlled ventilation that improves indoor air quality and reduces energy use."

Question:     What role do occupancy sensors play in a Building Automation System (BAS)?
Modal Answer: Occupancy sensors detect motion and presence, allowing the BAS to activate lighting and adjust temperature set-points based on real-time space utilization.
Student Ans:  occupancy sensors play in a Building Automation System 

GPT Feedback:
Right points: The student mentions occupancy sensors and Building Automation System (BAS).
Improve on: The answer lacks detail on how occupancy sensors work and their specific role in BAS. It should explain motion detection and adjustments to lighting and temperature.
Score: 70%
